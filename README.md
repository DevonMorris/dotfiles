## Set Up Script
The following command will install the dotfiles and create a backup of any
conflicting files as needed. Additionally it installs a bare git repo in the
`~/.dots` directory. Use the `dots` script to manage the dotfiles in this repo.
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevonMorris/dotfiles/master/scripts/init_dotfiles.sh | bash
```

## Bash
Check out my `.bashrc` and `.shell.d` folder for bash config.

## Neovim
I personally use [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) as my package manager in neovim.

## Awesome Window Manager
I use [awesome](https://awesomewm.org/) for my window manager. Check out the my `~/.config/awesome/rc.lua`.

## Mirrors
You can find my dotfiles on [my website](https://git.devonmorris.dev/dotfiles), [github](https://github.com/DevonMorris/dotfiles) and [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/DevonMorris/dotfiles)
