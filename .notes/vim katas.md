# Vim Katas

> Kata is a Japanese word meaning literally "form" referring to a detailed
> choreographed pattern of martial arts movements made to be practised.

Vim katas are a way for me to practice my vim skills and get better at new
things. They are inspired by a number of sources including [Practical Vim](https://pragprog.com/titles/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition),
[vimtricks](https://vimtricks.com/) and personal annoyances that I come across.

These katas are designed to harness the raw power of vim and neovim and as such
focus primarily on vim grammar, movements and built-in commands.
